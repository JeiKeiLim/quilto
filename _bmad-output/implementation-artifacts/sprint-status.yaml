#
# LLM CONFIGURATION:
# Sample config at: llm-config.yaml (project root)
# - Ollama URL: http://localhost:11434
# - Models: qwen2.5:3b (low tier), qwen2.5:7b (medium/high tier)
# - Qwen2.5 chosen for structured JSON output support
#
# DIRECTORY STRUCTURE:
# Stories are organized by epic subdirectory. See project-context.md for details.
# Example: epic-1/1-1-initialize-monorepo-structure.md

# STATUS DEFINITIONS:
# ==================
# Epic Status:
#   - backlog: Epic not yet started
#   - in-progress: Epic actively being worked on
#   - done: All stories in epic completed
#
# Epic Status Transitions:
#   - backlog → in-progress: Automatically when first story is created (via create-story)
#   - in-progress → done: Manually when all stories reach 'done' status
#
# Story Status:
#   - backlog: Story only exists in epic file
#   - ready-for-dev: Story file created in stories folder
#   - in-progress: Developer actively working on implementation
#   - review: Ready for code review (via Dev's code-review workflow)
#   - done: Story completed
#
# Retrospective Status:
#   - optional: Can be completed but not required
#   - done: Retrospective has been completed
#
# WORKFLOW NOTES:
# ===============
# - Epic transitions to 'in-progress' automatically when first story is created
# - Stories can be worked in parallel if team capacity allows
# - SM typically creates next story after previous one is 'done' to incorporate learnings
# - Dev moves story to 'review', then runs code-review (fresh context, different LLM recommended)
