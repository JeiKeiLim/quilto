# Story 1.5-3: Create Multi-Domain Test Entries

Status: done

## Story

As a **Quilto developer**,
I want **test entries for non-fitness domains**,
So that **Quilto proves it handles ANY domain, not just fitness**.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. **Journal domain entries exist** - At least 10 personal journal/diary entries covering mood, daily reflections, and personal notes in `tests/corpus/multi_domain/entries/journal/`

2. **Cooking domain entries exist** - At least 10 recipe/cooking log entries covering ingredients, cooking time, and notes in `tests/corpus/multi_domain/entries/cooking/`

3. **Study domain entries exist** - At least 10 study/learning note entries covering topics, duration, and comprehension in `tests/corpus/multi_domain/entries/study/`

4. **Minimal variation entries** - Each domain includes at least 2 entries with minimal content (very brief notes)

5. **Verbose variation entries** - Each domain includes at least 2 entries with verbose/detailed content

6. **Mixed-language entries** - Each domain includes at least 2 entries with Korean-English mixed content

7. **Total count** - At least 30 non-fitness entries total across all three domains

8. **README documentation** - A README.md exists in `tests/corpus/multi_domain/` explaining the structure and purpose

## Dev Notes

### File Count Summary

**Per domain:** 12 entries = 6 standard + 2 minimal + 2 verbose + 2 mixed
**Total:** 36 entries across 3 domains (exceeds AC #7 requirement of 30)

### Entry Content Guidelines

Each entry should be **realistic and natural** - as if written by a real person logging their activities:

**Journal entries should include:**
- Emotional state or mood indicators
- Daily activities and reflections
- Time references (morning, afternoon, etc.)
- Personal observations or feelings

**Cooking entries should include:**
- Dish name or description
- Ingredients with quantities (optional)
- Cooking time or duration
- Quality notes (too salty, turned out well, etc.)

**Study entries should include:**
- Subject or topic studied
- Duration or time spent
- Comprehension notes (understood, need review, etc.)
- Next steps or follow-up items

### Naming Convention

Follow the established pattern from existing corpus:
- `{domain}-{nn}.md` - Standard entries
- `{domain}-minimal-{nn}.md` - Minimal/brief entries
- `{domain}-verbose-{nn}.md` - Detailed/verbose entries
- `{domain}-mixed-{nn}.md` - Korean-English mixed entries

### Example Entries (from epics.md)

**Journal:**
```
Felt anxious today. Meeting with boss went better than expected. Need to remember to breathe.
```

**Cooking:**
```
Made kimchi jjigae - 300g pork belly, 1 cup aged kimchi, 30 min simmer. Too salty.
```

**Study:**
```
Studied calculus 2 hours. Integration by parts finally clicked. Review chain rule tomorrow.
```

### Project Structure Notes

- All entries go in `tests/corpus/multi_domain/entries/` (Quilto test infrastructure)
- Expected outputs will be created in Story 1.5-4 (separate story)
- Schemas will be defined in `tests/corpus/schemas/` (Story 1.5-4)
- This story creates INPUT data only; OUTPUT expectations are in the next story

### Alignment with Existing Patterns

Pattern follows `tests/corpus/generic/multilingual/` and `tests/corpus/generic/edge_cases/`:
- Simple markdown files with raw text content
- No special formatting required in entry files
- README.md provides documentation and structure overview
