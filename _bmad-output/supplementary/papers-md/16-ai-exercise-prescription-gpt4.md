**ABSTRACT:** The rise of artificial intelligence (AI) applications in healthcare provides new possibilities for
personalized health management. AI-based fitness applications are becoming more common, facilitating the
opportunity for individualised exercise prescription. However, the use of AI carries the risk of inadequate expert
supervision, and the efficacy and validity of such applications have not been thoroughly investigated, particularly
in the context of diverse health conditions. The aim of the study was to critically assess the efficacy of exercise
prescriptions generated by OpenAI’s Generative Pre-Trained Transformer 4 (GPT-4) model for five example patient
profiles with diverse health conditions and fitness goals. Our focus was to assess the model’s ability to generate
exercise prescriptions based on a singular, initial interaction, akin to a typical user experience. The evaluation was
conducted by leading experts in the field of exercise prescription. Five distinct scenarios were formulated, each
representing a hypothetical individual with a specific health condition and fitness objective. Upon receiving details
of each individual, the GPT-4 model was tasked with generating a 30-day exercise program. These AI-derived
exercise programs were subsequently subjected to a thorough evaluation by experts in exercise prescription. The
evaluation encompassed adherence to established principles of frequency, intensity, time, and exercise type;
integration of perceived exertion levels; consideration for medication intake and the respective medical condition;
and the extent of program individualization tailored to each hypothetical profile. The AI model could create general
safety-conscious exercise programs for various scenarios. However, the AI-generated exercise prescriptions lacked
precision in addressing individual health conditions and goals, often prioritizing excessive safety over the effectiveness
of training. The AI-based approach aimed to ensure patient improvement through gradual increases in training
load and intensity, but the model’s potential to fine-tune its recommendations through ongoing interaction was
not fully satisfying. AI technologies, in their current state, can serve as supplemental tools in exercise prescription,
particularly in enhancing accessibility for individuals unable to access, often costly, professional advice. However,
AI technologies are not yet recommended as a substitute for personalized, progressive, and health conditionspecific prescriptions provided by healthcare and fitness professionals. Further research is needed to explore more
interactive use of AI models and integration of real-time physiological feedback.

The growth of artificial intelligence (AI) has generated countless

possibilities in various fields, including healthcare and fitness [1–4].


With the ability to process vast amounts of data and generate


personalised recommendations, AI has emerged as a captivating


and promising tool in exercise prescription [1]. However, despite

the rapid development and implementation of AI-driven fitness



****


applications, the ability of these technologies to deliver person­


alised, effective and, most importantly, safe exercise regimens for

individuals with specific health conditions involving varying sever­


ity or co-morbidities remains largely unexplored. Adherence to


physical activity (PA) guidelines is indisputably a key determinant


of health, with a profound impact on the prevention and

management of a range of health conditions, including cardiovas­


cular diseases [5], respiratory diseases [6], diabetes mellitus [7],


mental health disorders (eg; anxiety [8, 9], depression [10]), and


Alzheimer disease [11, 12]. However, exercise prescription is not

a one-size-fits-all approach or solution [13]. Numerous factors,

such as individual health status, age, lifestyle, and personal fitness

goals, influence the effectiveness and safety of an exercise regimen,


thereby necessitating personalised exercise programs [13]. While

a multitude of fitness applications aiming to offer a degree of in­


dividualisation in exercise prescription have entered the mar­


ket [14, 15], they often fail to encompass the complexity of spe­

cific health conditions and the influence of medications [16], and


an individual’s psychosocial factors [17]. Accordingly, this sce­


nario represents a notable limitation of these applications in their


current form, potentially restricting their safe usability for indi­

viduals with specific health concerns.

The emergence of AI chatbots shows promise in filling the need


for more automated exercise prescriptions. By integrating large-scale


data analytics with machine learning algorithms, these AI-powered

systems can generate personalised recommendations in various fields,

including nutrition [18], mental health [19, 20], and fitness [4, 21].


Nevertheless, these technologies also harbour their own set of limi­


tations [22–24], such as the lack of empathetic human touch, pri­


vacy concerns, and challenges in transforming broad guidelines into


individualised recommendations.

The aim of the study was to critically assess the efficacy of exer­


cise prescriptions generated by OpenAI’s Generative Pre-Trained Trans­

former 4 (GPT-4) model. These prescriptions, tailored for five hypo­

thetical individuals with diverse health conditions and fitness goals,


were subjected to evaluation by several leading experts in exercise


prescription.


**MATERIALS AND METHODS**


This research was a simulation study designed to assess the poten­


tial of OpenAI’s GPT-4 model in producing individualised exercise


programs for hypothetical patients with diverse health conditions and

fitness goals. The study comprised four main phases: i) Scenario


Creation, ii) GPT-4 prompt, iii) Exercise program generation (pre­


sented in the results section) and iv) Expert evaluation (presented in


the Discussion section).


**ChatGPT for exercise prescription**


_Scenario Creation_

Five hypothetical patient profiles were created by the principal investi­


gators (ID, HBS, KC in the authors’ list) with formal training and exper­


tise in sports medicine, exercise science, and exercise physiology (Fig­

ure 1). The profiles included variables such as sex, age, height, weight,


body mass index (BMI), medical conditions, medications intake, mean


calorie intake, basal metabolic rate (BMR, estimated using the Harris

Benedict equations for females [25] and males [26]), motivations (ie;

specific fitness goals), level of PA, and profession or occupation. The


scenarios were intentionally diverse to represent a wide range of health

conditions and fitness objectives prevalent in the general population.


_GPT-4 Prompt_

We tasked GPT-4 with crafting a consistent fitness program suited

for five distinct scenarios. The unified directive was as follows: _“Cre­_

_ate a well-rounded 30-day fitness program table that seamlessly_


_integrates workout sessions and rest days. To optimize the effective­_


_ness of this routine, pay special attention to the FITT concept, which_


_dictates the Frequency (how often), Intensity (how hard), Time (how_


_long), and Type (what kind) of exercises to incorporate. Use the rate_


_of perceived exertion (RPE) scale, a measure of how intense the_


_exercise feels, to tailor the program to individual comfort levels._


_For the cardiovascular exercises, apply heart rate (HR) monitoring,_


_a reliable method to adjust the exercise intensity, ensuring it is just_


_right for each individual. For the strength-building exercises, adopt_


_the one repetition maximum (1RM) principle, a standard that in­_


_dicates the maximum weight someone can lift for one repetition,_


_to set the appropriate workout intensity.”_


_Exercise Program Generation and Evaluation_


Upon generating the programs, a comprehensive evaluation was


undertaken by a panel of experts in exercise prescription. This dis­


tinguished panel comprised academic professors and doctors from

the fields of sports medicine, exercise science, clinical exercise


physiology, and rehabilitation.


The evaluators were from a diverse set of twenty countries, in­


cluding: Australia, the Basque Country, Brazil, Chile, China, France,


Iran, Italy, Japan, Jordan, Malaysia, Mexico, Norway, Poland, Qatar,


Syria, Switzerland, Tunisia, the United Kingdom, the United Arab


Emirates, and the United States of America. This broad geographic

representation ensured a reflection of varied national norms and prac­


tices in exercise prescription. Each evaluator held a Ph.D. in exer­

cise science and/or medicine and occupied a significant role in aca­


demia, with many serving as editors, associate editors or editor-in-chief

for one or more esteemed academic journals in the field.


To mitigate subjective judgments and enhance the study’s objec­


tivity, we intentionally selected evaluators from different countries,


backgrounds, and educational experiences. We aimed to minimize


subjectivity, ensuring a comprehensive and accurate evaluation by


consolidating feedback from all contributors. Furthermore, to bolster

the study’s reliability, we followed the criteria of “Defining the Role



of Authors and Contributors” as outlined by the International Com­


mittee of Medical Journal Editors guidelines [27]. Only those who


made substantial contributions to the study were listed as authors.

Contributors who made less significant contributions or improve­


ments to the manuscript were duly acknowledged.


In the methodology of our research, we adopted an innovative ap­


proach consistent with the study’s pioneering spirit. While conven­


tional methodologies favour traditional evaluation scales, we inten­


tionally chose a quasi-qualitative direction. This decision was made

to benefit from the collective expertise and insights of our interna­


tional panel of experts in exercise prescription. Rather than restrict­


ing ourselves to a quantitative scale, our methodology leaned towards


this richer approach, aptly aligning with the unique scope of our


study. It is pertinent to note a potential limitation here: the absence


of a traditional scale, which some might anticipate in evaluations of


this nature. Under the supervision of lead investigators (ID, HBS,


and KC in the authors’ list), our evaluation strategy was subjected to

a rigorous three-stage refinement process. The initial phase involved


sharing a draft with co-authors for feedback. This was followed by

stages of iterative refinement based on collective insights, and the

process concluded with a final review for accuracy and complete­


ness. For brevity, certain GPT-4 outputs were reformatted into 10 ta­

bles without any other modification.


_Single-Prompt Approach: Our Methodology Behind AI Interaction_


In the process of generating exercise programs using the GPT-4


model, our approach was designed to mirror a typical patient expe­


rience with ChatGPT. The prompts provided to the AI model contained


basic information that any sports enthusiast or beginner might read­

ily find on the internet. This methodology was chosen to simulate


a real-world scenario where individuals might seek exercise advice

without the benefit of multiple rounds of expert interaction.


As sports scientists and exercise medicine specialists, we recognize

that iterative interactions with the model, refining and adjusting inputs,


could potentially yield a more precise and tailored exercise program.

Such a program would inevitably reflect the unique background, exper­


tise, and preferences of a practicing sports scientist. However, two pri­


mary reasons guided our decision against this approach: i) Iterative in­


teractions were not the primary objective of our study. Our focus was


on assessing the model’s capability to generate exercise prescriptions


based on a singular, initial interaction, akin to a typical, lay person user


experience; and ii) the scope and length of our study, already extensive


(with over 7700 words and 10 tables), limited the feasibility of con­


ducting multiple rounds of interactions and evaluations for each sce­


nario. Engaging in such a detailed iterative process would have been

feasible for a single case report, but not for the five diverse scenarios


we chose to present in this study. For clarity and precision, it is vital to


note that the creation of the scenarios and the responses from GPT-4


occurred on 25 June 2023. Given that ChatGPT’s performance can

evolve over time, underscoring this specific date ensures the context


and accuracy of our study are well-documented.

**RESULTS**

_Scenario 1_

_A. Author Prompt_


John – Cardiovascular Health Focus


– Sex: Male


– Age: 45 years


– Height: 178 cm


– Weight: 84 kg


– BMI: 26.5 kg/m²


– Medical Condition: Arterial hypertension


– Medications: John is currently taking _Amlodipine_, a calcium chan­


nel blocker, to manage his blood pressure.


– Mean calorie intake: 2,200 calories per day


– BMR: Approximately 1,800 calories per day


– Motivation: Improve cardiovascular health, reduce reliance on


medication, and enhance overall well-being through regular PA.



**Ismail Dergaa** _et al._


_B. GPT-4 response_


Given John’s hypertensive condition and goals, a combination of

cardio, strength, and flexibility training would be beneficial. Cardio


exercise helps lower blood pressure, strength training can aid in

weight management, and flexibility exercises improve overall body


functions. All exercises should be performed at a moderate intensity


(RPE 4–6 out of 10). Here is a sample 30-day exercise program


(Table 1). This program alternates between cardio- and strength

training days, with one day of rest every third day. The “strength


training (whole body)” refers to a mix of exercises that target all


major muscle groups. For example, it could include squats, lunges,


push-ups, seated rowing, and core exercises. As always, John should


consult with his doctor before starting this or any other exercise


program. He should also monitor his blood pressure regularly and


pay attention to how he feels during exercise, especially if he experi­


ences any discomfort or unusual symptoms.

_C. Interaction with GPT-4_

_C.1. Author Prompt_


Could you consider elaborating on the workout sessions, perhaps by


detailing changes in intensity within a single session? Also, it might

be beneficial to incorporate the RPE scale as an additional measure


of exercise intensity.


_C.2. GPT-4’s response_

Absolutely, I can definitely provide a more detailed session breakdown.


I will provide an example for a walking session and a strength train­


ing session (Table 2).


_Scenario 2_

_A. Author Prompt_


Sarah – Musculoskeletal Strength Emphasis


– Sex: Female


– Age: 35 years


– Height: 168 cm


– Weight: 68 kg


– BMI: 24.1 kg/m²


– Medical condition: Osteoarthritis


– Medications: Sarah occasionally takes over-the-counter anti-in­


flammatory medication, like _Ibuprofen_, to alleviate joint


discomfort.


– Mean calorie intake: 1,800 calories per day


– BMR: Approximately 1,500 calories per day


– Motivation: Strengthen muscles to support joints, overcome phys­


ical challenges, and lead a more active lifestyle.



_B. GPT-4’s response_


Given Sarah’s osteoarthritis condition, a combination of strength

training, low-impact cardio, and flexibility exercises would be ben­

eficial. Strength training can help strengthen the muscles surround­


ing her joints, which can alleviate some of the pressure and reduce


pain. Low-impact cardio exercises are easier on the joints while


helping improve cardiovascular health. Flexibility exercises can help


maintain joint mobility and function. Here is a sample 30-day exer­


cise program, including more detailed session breakdowns for strength


and cardio sessions (Table 3). “Strength Training (Whole body)” refers


to a mix of exercises that target all major muscle groups, focusing


on controlled movements to avoid joint strain. For example, it could


include leg press, seated row, chest press, lat pull-down, and core


exercises.


For strength training and swimming (Table 4), let’s use a similar


structure to the previous detailed sessions but adapted for Sarah.


Sarah should adjust the intensity of her exercises based on her own


perceived exertion, comfort level, and any joint pain. As always, she


should consult with her doctor before starting this or any other ex­


ercise program, especially due to her osteoarthritis condition.

– Medications: Emily is under the care of a psychiatrist and is pre­


scribed Sertraline, an antidepressant, to manage her anxiety.


– Mean calorie intake: 1,600 calories per day


– BMR: Approximately 1,350 calories per day

– Motivation: Improve mental health, find inner peace, and achieve


emotional balance through yoga and mindfulness practices.


_B. GPT-4’s response_

Given Emily’s goal of improving mental health and increasing flexibil­


ity, incorporating practices such as yoga, meditation, and low-inten­

sity cardio exercise such as walking, or cycling can be highly benefi­

cial. Yoga has been shown to improve flexibility, balance, and strength,


while also having positive effects on mental health, reducing anxiety,


and stress. Here is a sample 30-day exercise program, including


more detailed session breakdowns for yoga and cardio sessions


(Table 5).


For yoga and walking/cycling (Table 6), let’s use a similar struc­


ture to the previous detailed sessions but adapted for Emily. Emily


should adjust the intensity of her exercises based on her own per­


ceived exertion, comfort level, and any mental or physical discom­


fort. As always, she should consult with her doctor before starting


this or any other exercise program, especially given her mental health


condition.

– BMR: Approximately 1,850 calories per day


– Motivation: Manage diabetes effectively, lose weight to improve


overall health, and enhance well-being through PA and proper


nutrition.


_B. GPT-4’s response_


Given Mike’s objective of managing his diabetes mellitus and losing


weight, a combination of regular cardio exercise, strength training,

and dietary adjustments can be very beneficial. Regular PA can help


improve insulin sensitivity, while a healthy diet can help manage


blood glucose levels and contribute to weight loss. Here is a sample


30-day exercise program, including more detailed session breakdowns


for strength and cardio sessions (Table 7). “Strength Training (Whole


body)” refers to a mix of exercises that target all major muscle groups,


focusing on controlled movements to avoid joint strain. For example,

# 228

it could include leg press, seated row, chest press, lat pull-down, and


core exercises.


For strength training and cardio sessions (Table 8), let’s use a sim­


ilar structure to the previous detailed sessions but adapted for Mike.


_Scenario 5_

_A. Author Prompt_


Lisa – Respiratory Health and Pulmonary Function


– Sex: Female


– Age: 40 years


– Height: 162 cm


– Weight: 70 kg


– BMI: 26.7 kg/m²


– Medical condition: Asthma and reduced pulmonary function


– Medications: Lisa uses an inhaler (Albuterol) as a bronchodilator


to manage her asthma symptoms.


– Mean calorie intake: 1,900 calories per day


– BMR: Approximately 1,600 calories per day


– Fitness objective: Improve respiratory health and lung capacity,


manage asthma effectively, and lead an active lifestyle.


_B. GPT-4’s response_


Given Lisa’s objective of improving her respiratory health and pul­


monary function, a combination of regular low-impact cardio and


resistance exercises, along with breathing exercises, could be very

beneficial. Regular PA can help increase lung capacity, improve car­

diovascular health, and enhance overall fitness. Additionally, spe­

cific breathing exercises can help strengthen the respiratory muscles,


increase lung function, and manage asthma symptoms effectively.


Here is a sample 30-day exercise program for Lisa (Table 9). “Re­


sistance Training (Whole body)” refers to a mix of exercises that


target all major muscle groups, focusing on controlled movements


and proper breathing techniques to avoid respiratory strain.


Here is a detailed breakdown of Lisa’s resistance training session


(Table 10). For each exercise, Lisa should take slow, deep breaths,


exhaling on the exertion phase and inhaling on the return. If she feels


any shortness of breath, she should slow down or take a break, and


use her inhaler if necessary. Breathing exercises are also an integral


part of her program. Pursed-lip breathing involves inhaling through


the nose and exhaling slowly through puckered lips, while diaphrag­


matic breathing focuses on fully engaging the diaphragm, not just


the chest, during breaths. These exercises can help increase lung ca­


pacity and improve respiratory muscle function, thereby helping to


manage asthma symptoms. As always, she should consult with her


doctor before starting this or any other exercise program, especially


given her asthma condition.

and fitness goals. Our focus was on assessing the model’s capabil­


ity to generate exercise prescriptions based on a singular, initial in­


teraction, akin to a typical user experience. This evaluation was

conducted by leading experts in the field of exercise prescription.


Through this assessment, we aimed to understand the potential and

limitations of AI, specifically GPT-4, in crafting personalised exercise


programs, juxtaposing its outputs against the insights and expertise


traditionally provided by human professionals in the domain.


_Evaluation and Review: Scenario 1 – John_


John’s case represents a typical middle-aged individual suffering from


arterial hypertension, aiming to enhance his cardiovascular health


and reduce medication dependence through a structured exercise


program. The generated 30-day regimen shows a commendable


application of the FITT principles, incorporating a blend of cardio­

vascular exercises, resistance training, and flexibility routines, all of

which are demonstrably beneficial for hypertensive individuals and


cardiovascular health in general [28, 29].


The program’s heavy reliance on moderate-intensity workouts is


in line with recommendations for hypertensive patients, reducing the


likelihood of excessive spikes in blood pressure during exercise [30].


This approach aligns with a conservative strategy that prioritizes un­


derstanding how the individual reacts to moderate-intensity exercise


before exploring more intense options.


While emerging research indicates that high-intensity interval


training (HIIT) could offer substantial cardiovascular and hyperten­

sive benefits [31, 32], the decision to exclude HIIT from the initial


30-day program is consistent with a personalized and cautious ap­


proach. A human practitioner might rationalize current decisions


based on prior experiences, successes, and failures. For instance, if


a practitioner had previously observed a patient with similar health


conditions to John experiencing adverse reactions to HIIT, they might


be more cautious and exclude HIIT from John’s program. In this con­

text, the exclusion of HIIT seems prudent, reflecting the practitio­


ner’s accumulated knowledge and experience over time. The Chat­


GPT-formulated program, while based on prevalent information from


the Internet, might prioritise information that is more abundant or


historically prevalent over newer, potentially more relevant expert in­


sights. This means that while GPT-4 can access a vast amount of


information, it may not always prioritise the most recent or expert

endorsed data. As a result, traditional practices with a wealth of on­


line information might be favoured over newer, updated methodolo­


gies. This highlights a limitation in the model’s ability to discern the


quality and relevance of the information it accesses.


Introducing HIIT might be a valuable addition to the program in


the future, but only after careful monitoring and assessment of the


individual’s response to the initial regimen. This approach recognis­


es that exercise prescription can be subjective and based on individ­


ual preferences and needs, and emphasises the importance of per­


sonalised care in managing hypertensive conditions. A prudent


approach also acknowledges the nuanced judgment that human



practitioners bring to exercise prescription, balancing evidence-based


practice with individualized care.


While the HR-based approach for managing workout intensity is

noteworthy, it would have been beneficial to incorporate specific HR


zones for each cardio session [33]. For hypertensive patients like


John, individualized HR zone training could prove particularly ben­

eficial [34]. A common approach to establishing these zones involves

first estimating the predicted maximal HR (MHR) (usually using the


“220-age” formula [35]). Then, the Karvonen formula [36] [target


training HR = resting HR + (0.6 × (MHR – resting HR))] is applied,


followed by calculating different training zones as percentages of this


target HR [37]. However, one should be cautious with the use of


predicted MHR calculations as several estimation issues should not


be overlooked; ideally, the real MHR of the individual should be mea­

sured by qualified practitioners [38]. Indeed, if a patient estimates


his/her HR zones using an inappropriate formula, it could lead to an


inadequate exercise intensity. GPT-4 did not mention any details


about how to calculate those HR zones, and predicted MHR. This


shortcoming might not only hinder the effectiveness of the exercise


program but also pose potential health risks, particularly for individ­


uals with underlying medical conditions such as arterial hyperten­


sion. Accurate calculation and understanding of HR zones are essen­


tial for tailoring an exercise regimen that is both safe and effective

for the individual’s specific needs and goals.


Resistance training has sensibly been included in the program,


aligning with research demonstrating its positive impact on blood


pressure and cardiovascular health [39, 40]. Nonetheless, high-re­

sistance strength training may lead to a significant transient increase


in systolic and diastolic blood pressure [41]. Consequently, a pro­


gram design leaning towards lower resistance with higher repetitions


might be a safer alternative for John, while still providing the bene­

fits of resistance training, without the associated acute blood pres­


sure elevation [42].


An evident progression in terms of exercise duration is a strong


point of the program. However, it appears to overlook the progres­


sion in other crucial areas, such as workout intensity, the weight used


in resistance training, and the complexity of exercises. A program in­


corporating systematic progression in these elements might stimu­

late continual adaptation and improvement, offering greater benefits


for John. Another element seemingly absent from the program is RPE


monitoring [43]. RPE could provide a more reliable measure of work­


out intensity than HR alone [44].


The program effectively integrates rest days, underscoring their


importance in facilitating recovery and adaptation. However, the cur­


rent placement of these rest days, predominantly after strength train­


ing sessions, raises questions. Strategically positioning rest days af­


ter high-intensity workouts or after a series of consecutive


moderate-intensity sessions can optimize muscle recovery and re­


duce the risk of overtraining [45]. Thus, re-evaluating the sequenc­


ing of rest days in this context may enhance the overall effectiveness


of the program. Furthermore, it is essential to note the increase in

# B iology of S port, V ol . 41 N o 2, 2024  231


self-paced exercise recommendations, especially for specific popu­


lations. Such exercises allow individuals to adjust their workout in­


tensity based on their comfort and capability, which can be partic­

ularly beneficial for those taking certain medications that might affect


their physiological response to exercise. The GPT-4 program also


seemed limited by meeting (but not surpassing) the PA guideline of


150 minutes per week of moderate to vigorous PAs. The necessity


of two rest days per week should also be questioned as some pa­


tients may prefer to exercise in smaller “doses” more than 5 times


per week.


Additionally, the importance of isometric exercises and varied con­


traction regimens cannot be overlooked. Different health disorders

may necessitate specific contraction patterns to maximize therapeu­

tic benefits. A recent network meta-analysis reported that isometric


exercise may provide the largest improvement in resting blood pres­


sure [40]. For instance, isometric exercises, which involve muscle

contractions without any significant movement, can be especially

beneficial for individuals with certain joint or muscular disorders.

The program could benefit from integrating these exercises, tailoring

the contraction regimen to the specific needs of the individual’s health


condition. However, patients should be warned to avoid the Valsal­


va manoeuvre while performing isometric exercises to avoid any over­


load on the cardiovascular system, and there were no cautions high­


lighted on this aspect by the proposed program [46].


Lastly, even if not prompted for, we believe that the proposed pro­


gram should have touched on the patient diet with at least a list of


food to avoid in association with arterial hypertension. Indeed, any


clinical practitioner if confronted with suggesting an exercise-based


program for hypertensive patient will most probably consider asso­


ciated risk factors like nutrition or sleep.


The exercise program generated by GPT-4 exhibits a solid grasp


of fundamental exercise prescription principles. However, there is

room for refinement in areas like individualised intensity measures,


systematic progression, nuanced application of resistance training


guidelines, and incorporation of RPE as a training monitoring tool.


With these adjustments, the program could potentially provide fur­

ther health benefits for John.


_Evaluation and Review: Scenario 2 – Sarah_


Sarah, a 35-year-old female diagnosed with osteoarthritis, aspires


to augment her musculoskeletal strength, mitigate her joint discom­


fort, and live a more active lifestyle. The AI model’s proposed exercise


plan, designed around FITT principles, provides a suitable starting


point for such objectives. However, the program warrants a more


detailed critique, particularly in the context of osteoarthritis manage­

ment and the potential therapeutic benefits of PA.


First, the model appropriately prescribes strength-training exer­


cises, a cornerstone of non-pharmacological management for osteo­


arthritis [47]. Not only does resistance training improve muscular


strength, but enhances joint stability and function and alleviating os­


teoarthritis symptoms [47]. However, the prescription lacks

# 232



**Ismail Dergaa** _et al._


specificity in terms of the intended load, repetitions, and sets for each

exercise, which might influence the therapeutic effectiveness.


To illustrate, a typical exercise prescription for someone like Sar­


ah might specify that she should perform leg presses at 60% of her


1RM, for three sets of 10 repetitions, with a 2-minute rest in-be­


tween. This level of detail ensures that the exercise is tailored to her


current strength level, providing a clear progression path. However,


there was no instruction for how she safely determine her 1RM for


each exercise. The AI’s recommendation might have been more ge­


neric, indicating leg presses while specifying the weight, repetitions,

and sets. Such a lack of specificity, while more general and perhaps


easier to adopt, could however lead to suboptimal results and even


potential injury if Sarah were to guess the appropriate weight or


overexert herself.

Secondly, the AI model rightly includes flexibility exercises in the


program, which are crucial for maintaining joint range of motion and


reducing stiffness associated with osteoarthritis [48]. However, the


model could have suggested exercises for enhancing proprioception


and neuromuscular control exercises, such as balance and agility


training, which are often compromised in individuals with


osteoarthritis [49].


Regarding cardiovascular exercises, the model adequately intro­


duces low-intensity activities (ie; walking). This aspect is critical


considering the load-bearing nature of osteoarthritis, particularly as


it affects Sarah’s lower limbs. Nevertheless, the model could have


suggested non-weight-bearing activities such as cycling, which may

reduce joint stress while promoting cardiovascular fitness [50].


Furthermore, the program could have been further individualised


by considering the affected joints and tailoring the exercises accord­


ingly. For example, if Sarah’s osteoarthritis affects her knees, cer­


tain exercises such as deep squats shall be avoided due to exces­


sive knee joint load [51, 52]. It is worth noting that while there were


traditional reservations about land-based exercises for individuals


with osteoarthritis, recent research and clinical practices have


evolved. Land-based exercises, when performed with proper tech­

nique and under expert guidance, can be beneficial for osteoarthri­


tis patients [51, 52]. They can help improve joint mobility, muscle


strength, and overall functional capacity. Moreover, these exercises


can be adapted to ensure minimal joint stress while maximizing

therapeutic benefits. For instance, shallow squats or partial range


movements can be introduced to reduce undue strain on affected


joints. The key lies in the correct execution, progression, and indi­

vidualisation of these exercises to suit the specific needs and limi­


tations of the osteoarthritis patient. This aspect is overlooked by the


model.


The information provided to Sarah also recommended an evalu­


ation by a doctor before commencing her exercise program. This


recommendation, which is based on older guidelines, is incorrect


since new guidelines support that low-risk patients do not require


a screening examination or “medical clearance” to begin an exer­


cise program [53]. Of course, Sarah could pursue this for added


**ChatGPT for exercise prescription**


safety, but the GPT-4 model could have presented this option with­


out making it a barrier for those with poor access to care.


Finally, the model logically incorporates rest days into the pro­


gram, which are essential for promoting tissue healing and recovery,


thus reducing the risk of exacerbating Sarah’s osteoarthritis symp­


toms. However, Sarah could engage in light activities such as stretch­

ing or yoga on “rest” days, thus promoting flexibility and relaxation,


adding value without hampering recovery. A more detailed, tailored,

and multifaceted approach that considers the specific nuances of her


osteoarthritis could better cater to Sarah’s needs, and help her achieve

her fitness objectives more effectively and safely.


_Evaluation and Review: Scenario 3 – Emily_


Emily is a 27-year-old individual grappling with anxiety and stress

related issues, and managed with _Sertraline_, an antidepressant. Her

objective was to enhance her mental health, find inner peace, and


achieve emotional balance through yoga and mindfulness practices.


Given the increasing popularity and frequent requests for yoga as


a potential solution for such health conditions, the AI model suggests


a detailed yoga-centric program, constructed in adherence to FITT


principles. While Yoga is a commonly sought-after intervention, it is


essential to acknowledge that many other behavioral and cognitive

interventions have shown beneficial results. However, an in-depth


analysis reveals some areas for potential improvement. Moreover,


the program seems to overlook crucial factors like sleep quality and


chronotype, which play a pivotal role in managing anxiety and stress.


The model appropriately emphasizes yoga and meditation, both

of which are well-documented for their beneficial effects on mental


health, stress reduction, and overall well-being [54]. The model cor­


rectly provides for a gradual increase in session length, permitting


Emily to adapt progressively to the increasing demands of the pro­


gram. However, the program could have been improved by provid­

ing specific details about the yoga poses and sequences suitable for


stress relief, such as restorative or Yin Yoga, along with guidance on

proper alignment and modification options to suit Emily’s comfort


and skill level. This outcome may be possible through links to other


resources and instructional videos. In addition, as with scenario 2,


the GPT-4 model recommended a medical evaluation before begin­


ning the exercise program which is not necessary in an otherwise


healthy young adult.


The prescription of daily yoga sessions, coupled with mindfulness


exercises, shows the model’s understanding of the importance of


consistency in mental health-related physical activities. However, the


prescription does not adequately account for the rest and recovery


necessary to prevent potential physical and mental fatigue associat­


ed with daily yoga practices [55]. Incorporating rest days or days


with lighter, restorative practices could potentially improve this as­


pect of the program.


The model’s program also includes a ‘perceived exertion’ mea­


sure, the Borg scale, to self-assess the intensity of the yoga sessions.


While this can be a useful tool for cardio-based workouts, it may not



be entirely suitable for yoga, where intensity can vary significantly


based on the type of Yoga and individual postures [55]. A more ap­

propriate measure might be a discomfort or difficulty scale, particu­


larly suited to the slower pace and holding postures of yoga. Lastly,


the model does not incorporate any form of aerobic or strength train­


ing exercises in Emily’s program [56, 57]. While her primary focus


is on mental health and yoga practices, including these forms of ex­

ercises could provide complementary benefits. Aerobic exercises, for


instance, are known to promote endorphin release, aiding in mood


improvement [58], while strength training can boost self-esteem and

body image, providing an additional mental health benefit [59].


_Evaluation and Review: Scenario 4 – Mike_


Mike, a 50-year-old male diagnosed with type 2 diabetes mellitus,


aims to manage his disease effectively, lose weight, and improve his


overall health and well-being. The AI model recommends a program

that combines cardiovascular, strength, and flexibility exercises, abid­


ing by FITT principles. While this program aligns with general recom­


mendations for managing diabetes mellitus and promoting weight

loss, it lacks specificity and a more nuanced understanding of exer­


cise prescription in the context of diabetes management.


The model correctly prescribes cardiovascular exercise as a vital

component of Mike’s program, given its well-documented benefits in


enhancing insulin sensitivity, aiding glucose control, and promoting


weight loss [60]. However, it misses a crucial point: the potential


rare risk of hypoglycemia during and following prolonged aerobic ex­


ercise for individuals on glucose-lowering medications [61, 62]. It is


essential for patients like Mike, especially if they are on _metformin_,

to be cognizant of exercise-induced glucose fluctuations. While _met­_


_formin_ generally reduces the risk of exercise-induced hypoglycemia


due to its mechanism of action on liver glucose production, some


nuances need to be considered. A more personalised approach for


_metformin_ users would involve monitoring blood glucose levels pre
and post-exercise to understand any unexpected fluctuations. Indi­


viduals should also be made aware of the potential for gastrointes­


tinal side effects of _metformin_, which might be exacerbated with


exercise. As always, it is advisable to consult with a healthcare pro­


vider for individualised guidance, especially when initiating a new


exercise regimen while on _metformin_ [63, 64]. Furthermore, the in­


clusion of high-intensity low-volume endurance exercises, such as


HIIT or moderate-intensity interval training, could offer additional

benefits, and should be considered in the exercise prescription.


Strength training exercises are appropriately included, given their


role in improving muscle mass and insulin sensitivity, thereby aiding


in glucose control [65]. However, the program could be improved by


specifying the types of resistance exercises to be performed, their or­


der, and the amount of resistance (in relation to Mike’s actual or es­


timated 1RM), how to safely determine one’s 1RM, and facilitating


the safe and effective execution of these exercises.

The program’s inclusion of flexibility exercises, which aid in main­


taining joint health and overall mobility, is also commendable [48].

# B iology of S port, V ol . 41 N o 2, 2024  233


However, the model does not provide any specific stretching exer­


cises or guidance on how these should be performed, which could


be helpful for preventing potential injury [66].


Given that both hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia can occur in


individuals with diabetes mellitus due to exercise, education about


self-monitoring of blood glucose and guidance on appropriate re­


sponses to abnormal glucose levels are vital [67].


Furthermore, the model could have incorporated education about


the signs of hypoglycemia and foot care in the exercise program, giv­


en that individuals with diabetes mellitus are often at increased risk


of hypoglycemia and foot ulcers [68].


_Evaluation and Review: Scenario 5 – Lisa_


Lisa, a 40-year-old female with asthma and impaired pulmonary


function, has the objective of improving her respiratory health and


lung capacity. The AI model proposes a program combining cardio­

vascular, strength, and flexibility exercises, framed within the FITT

guidelines. The program captures a broad range of PAs beneficial for

overall health; however, the specificity and customization to cater to

Lisa’s specific condition seem to be lacking in certain aspects.


The model appropriately prescribes cardiovascular exercise, giv­

en its proven benefits in enhancing overall cardiorespiratory fit­


ness [69]. However, the program could have been enhanced by in­


corporating exercises particularly known for their positive impacts

on respiratory health [70]. Additionally, considering the benefits of


eccentric exercises, which are less stressful on the cardiorespirato­


ry system compared to other contraction regimens, their inclusion


could be advantageous for Lisa. The inclusion of strength training is


also pertinent, considering that improved muscle strength can help


reduce the overall work of breathing and enhance Lisa’s exercise tol­


erance [71]. Still, a more targeted approach could involve addition­

al exercises to specifically strengthen her respiratory muscles, such


as incentive spirometry or breathing against resistance [72–74], be­


yond the pursed-lip and diaphragmatic breathing suggested by GPT-4.

The model’s program incorporates flexibility exercises, beneficial


in maintaining overall joint and muscle health [75]. However, the


program could be better tailored by suggesting exercises to help en­


hance thoracic mobility and lung function.


The model correctly uses RPE as a method for Lisa to gauge her


exertion levels. However, given Lisa’s condition, additional guidance


on recognising the signs of exercise-induced bronchoconstriction [76],


such as unusual shortness of breath, chest tightness, or prolonged

recovery, would have been beneficial.


Furthermore, the program does not address the importance of


a proper warm-up and cool-down in preventing exercise-induced


bronchoconstriction symptoms, an oversight that could negatively

influence Lisa’s exercise experience and potentially increase the like­


lihood of drop out due to exercise related issues/discomfort. The


model also did not review proper use of a rescue inhaler for symp­


tom exacerbations during exercise, or the potential need for prophy­


lactic use before exercise. However, the model did recommend that

# 234



**Ismail Dergaa** _et al._


Lisa ensure her inhaler remains near-by, showing that the model con­


sidered her condition and the potential associated issues that the


patient might encounter while exercising.


_Overall Evaluation and Interpretation_


This study has explored the application of the GPT-4 model for per­

sonalised exercise prescription for five-example patient profiles with


various health conditions. The GPT model’s responses were able to


produce generally safe exercise programs grounded in the general


FITT principles and RPE guidelines, demonstrating the potential


utility of AI in generating basic exercise recommendations. However,


the analysis revealed several limitations and areas for improvement.

The programs suggested by ChatGPT placed a significant empha­


sis on safety, often prescribing moderate-intensity exercises rather


than high-intensity ones. While such a cautious approach is under­


standable, especially when introducing a new exercise regimen to


individuals, it might be perceived as overly conservative. For a short

term intervention over a month, this level of caution in the initial


weeks might be excessive. Ideally, after establishing a baseline in

the first couple of weeks, the intensity could be gradually increased.


Starting from the third or fourth week, a small increase in intensity


could better balance the goals of improving the patient’s health con­


dition while still maintaining safety. However, this progression also

depends on the level of fitness of the individual prior to the program

(see more below). For an extremely unfit individual, a more prolonged


preparation/transition period is warranted to diminish the likelihood


of dropping out.


The model’s inability to monitor an individual’s physiological re­


sponse and adjust in real-time is a limitation. While some emerging


technologies are beginning to offer this capability, ChatGPT, as used


here, cannot independently provide real-time feedback or adjust­


ments. This caution restricts the potential for optimal progress and


adaptation, which are essential for health improvement and the at­

tainment of specific goals [77].


Furthermore, the program’s lack of preliminary patient assess­


ment is a notable shortcoming. If the AI system were to request in­


formation such as the subject’s current physical condition, exercise


experience, or the length of time suffering from the health condition,


it could plan the exercise in a more individualised and effective man­


ner. In practice, a human practitioner, with the ability to assess the


individual’s responses in real-time, would likely provide a more var­


ied, dynamic, and intense program, challenging the individual while


ensuring safety and effectiveness with an appropriately individual­


ized prescription [77].


The monotony in program design, highlighted in the present anal­


ysis, points towards the lack of variability, another crucial principle


of training, in the GPT’s prescribed plans. While maintaining a cer­


tain level of consistency is necessary for habit formation and gradu­


al adaptation, introducing regular changes in exercise modes, inten­


sities, and volumes is essential to prevent plateaus in progress,


enhance motivation, and foster long-term adherence [78].


**ChatGPT for exercise prescription**


It seems that unless a patient is extremely unfit, the exercise reg­


imens developed by GPT-4 generally will allow individuals to main­


tain their current health status but fall short of providing the neces­

sary stimuli for significant advancements in their health or fitness.


Moreover, the holistic approach that leads to personalisation and cre­


ativity in exercise prescription goes beyond what AI-generated plans


can currently offer. This approach considers unique user attributes


and adapts in ways that resonate with their individual preferences


and needs. Even with technological advances, the prospect of AI sys­

tems fully replacing human expertise in the exercise prescription field


seems distant as of now (ie; August 2023).


Despite its shortcomings, the GPT model’s approach offers a cost

effective alternative for individuals who cannot afford personal train­


ers, yet it falls short of replicating the personalised service and ex­


pertise that human trainers provide. While “digital humans” may


provide a potential solution to facilitate knowledge transfer, motiva­


tion, and adherence, this study was designed only to evaluate the


content and appropriateness of the exercise recommendations. Al­


though not directly investigated in our study, the authors contend


that the nuances of human interaction, motivation, and real-time ad­


justment of training plans based on various factors likely remain un­


paralleled by AI in its current state. As indicated in the methodolo­

gy section, the decision to conduct this analysis without significant


interaction with the GPT model was deliberate and guided by sever­


al considerations. Primarily, the study sought to assess ChatGPT’s

ability to tailor training programs to specific patient requirements,


simulating the experience of a typical untrained layperson lacking


sports science knowledge. This approach allowed for critical evalu­


ation of the program from the perspective of sports medicine and


sports science specialists. Further iterative interactions with AI and


text expansion were beyond the scope of this study. We also assert

that a broader investigation of multiple health profiles would yield

more valuable insights than a narrow focus on a single profile with


numerous interactions. To ensure clarity, some evaluations, which


are common between scenarios, were addressed in the overall eval­


uation to avoid redundancy. Despite these limitations, the study

maintained objectivity by adopting an observational approach, avoid­


ing external factors that might alter the model’s responses. This


method facilitated a clear differentiation between the model’s inher­

ent knowledge and potential external influences.


Future research should explore the interactive capabilities of AI


models, including ChatGPT, to determine if they can be harnessed

to enhance the specificity and effectiveness of prescribed exercise


programs. Such studies may also consider focusing on individual pa­


tient cases with multiple interactions to assess the model’s ability to


generate better-tailored training programs over successive rounds of


interaction. As AI technology advances, subsequent iterations of these

models may overcome existing limitations, enabling patients and fit­


ness professionals to utilize these tools for crafting more accessible,


personalized, and effective exercise prescriptions. Such advance­

ments can serve as valuable aids, amplifying the expertise of fitness



professionals rather than replacing them. This evolution emphasiz­


es the potential of AI to act as a collaborative tool, enriching the hu­

man element in the domain of fitness and health.


_Limitations_

In evaluating the application of AI, specifically the GPT-4 model, for


crafting personalized exercise programs, this study has uncovered

both promising avenues and significant limitations. These constraints


in addition to the limitations of our study must be carefully considered

when interpreting the findings.


One primary limitation was the static nature of the interaction with


the AI model. While personal and medical details were provided, along


with a request for a 30-day exercise program, the model’s ability to

refine and expand upon its initial recommendations through contin­


ued dialogue was not fully investigated. This approach led to some­

what generic recommendations, reflecting the study’s focus on a wide


array of medical conditions rather than an in-depth exploration of


a single case. Other studies should consider examining iterative inter­


actions with AI throughout the course of an exercise program.

Our patient profiles were intentionally simplistic with a singular


medical condition. Thus, our results may not be fully generalizable


to the performance of AI in formulating an exercise program for pa­


tients with multiple co-morbidities or more severe medical disorders.


This opportunity represents an important area of future research.

Another significant limitation is the quasi-qualitative aspect of the


study. While this approach offers some advantages, especially given


the pioneering nature of our research, the lack of a recognised and


validated scale is a substantial concern for such evaluations. This


gap underscores the necessity for future research dedicated to the


development of validated scales for evaluating chatbots-generated


programs, whether in sports medicine or broader medical science


contexts.


Furthermore, the current technological limitations of AI, which


preclude real-time physiological monitoring and responsive adjust­


ments to exercise prescriptions, were evident in the model’s tenden­


cy to prescribe extremely conservative programs. Without real-time


feedback, safety has been prioritised over challenge and progression,

potentially hindering fitness and health improvements. This limita­


tion is underscored by the contrast with other technological advance­


ments, such as the “precision motion technology “offered by “Hinge


Health” [79], which can provide the real-time monitoring currently


beyond the reach of AI models like GPT-4.

The lack of specificity and customisation in addressing individu­


al health conditions and goals also emerged as a limitation, impact­

ing the effectiveness of the programs and possibly influencing users’


motivation and adherence. Additionally, the study’s omission of fac­


tors such as ethnicity, exercise preferences, profession, lifestyle hab­


its, and other personal details further constrained the model’s abili­

ty to provide tailored fitness programs. Although attempts were made


to incorporate these details, the model’s unresponsiveness led the


authors to retain the original approach.

# B iology of S port, V ol . 41 N o 2, 2024  235


The model’s inclination towards safety over progression, while


understandable given the lack of real-time feedback, could obstruct

significant long-term fitness and health gains, especially for individ­

uals with specific health conditions requiring more targeted program­


ming. Finally, there are some individuals that will need the continu­


ous presence of a coach next to them to exercise [80, 81], and for


these persons AI may never provide an adequate solution.


Future research should pursue more dynamic and interactive de­


signs, exploring continued dialogue with AI models, and integration


of real-time physiological monitoring technology. Such advancements

could enhance the specificity and effectiveness of AI-generated ex­

ercise programs, opening new possibilities for personalised fitness


and health interventions.


**CONCLUSIONS**

Our findings indicate that AI technology (in this case OpenAI’s GPT-4)


can provide a baseline for safe exercise recommendations. However,


the technology may not offer the degree of complexity and adapt­

ability required for optimized long-term fitness and health improve­


ment. The exercise regimens developed by GPT-4 permit individuals

with average fitness to maintain their current health status, but do

not provide sufficient stimuli for obtaining substantial advancements

in their health or fitness. This conclusion highlights the irreplaceable


value of human expertise and experience in the realm of exercise

prescription. Live fitness specialists, with their ability to dynami­


cally adjust and personalise workout plans, maintain a decisive ad­


vantage over current AI technology in fostering meaningful physio­

logical adaptations and health benefits.


Chatbots AI technology, as it stands (mid 2023), appears to pos­


sess limitations that restrict its potential within the realm of person­


alised exercise prescription. Despite offering generally safe recom­

mendations, AI-generated fitness plans seem to lack the personalisation,

creativity, and variability that a fitness specialist can provide. For in­

stance, a fitness specialist could consider the patient’s fluctuating


energy levels and tailor the intensity of workouts, accordingly, ensur­


ing that the user remains engaged and motivated while avoiding


burnout. This level of holistic approach leads to personalization and


creativity beyond what AI-generated plans can offer, as it takes into


account unique user attributes and adapts in ways that resonate with


their individual preferences and needs. Even with technological ad­


vances, the full replacement of human expertise in the exercise pre­

scription field by AI systems seems distant. This study highlights ar­


eas of improvement for AI systems, such as enhancing real-time


interactions, improving personalisation and adaptability algorithms,


and integrating a greater degree of progression in exercise intensity


and variability in training. Only through such advancements can AI


provide exercise recommendations that come closer to matching the

quality and effectiveness of a live fitness specialist.
