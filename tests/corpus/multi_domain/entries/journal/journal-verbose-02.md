Spent the entire Saturday at my parents' house for our monthly family gathering. It's become a tradition over the past few years - ever since we realized that without scheduling these things deliberately, months would slip by without seeing each other.

Arrived around 10am to help mom prepare lunch. We made her famous lasagna together, the one with bechamel sauce that takes forever but tastes incredible. She taught me a few tricks I didn't know - like adding a bay leaf to the milk while making the bechamel. The kitchen was warm and smelled like garlic and herbs. Dad wandered in occasionally to "taste test" things, which really meant stealing pieces of mozzarella.

My sister came with her husband and their 4-year-old, Emma. That kid has so much energy it's exhausting just watching her. She wanted me to play hide and seek approximately 47 times. I hid in the same spot every time and she still squealed with delight each time she found me. Kids are wonderful and also completely insane.

Lunch went on for almost two hours. We talked about everything - politics (carefully), upcoming travel plans, my brother's new job, the neighbor's ongoing renovation that's been driving my parents crazy. My uncle joined via video call from Korea since he couldn't make it in person. Technology making distance feel smaller is something I don't appreciate enough.

After lunch, we looked through old photo albums. Found pictures from my high school graduation - the hair, the fashion choices, the confident ignorance of youth. Everyone aged so gracefully except for that hair. We laughed until we cried at some of the more embarrassing ones.

Drove home as the sun was setting, windows down, listening to old songs that reminded me of simpler times. These days remind me what actually matters. Work stress, deadlines, promotions - none of it compares to a warm kitchen and people who love you unconditionally.

Setting a reminder to call mom during the week. Need to tell her I love her more often.
