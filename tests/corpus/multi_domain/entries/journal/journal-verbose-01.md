Today was one of those days that starts off rocky but ends up being unexpectedly wonderful. I woke up late because I forgot to set my alarm last night - was too engrossed in that new mystery novel I started reading. Rushed through my morning routine, skipped breakfast (which I know is bad), and barely made it to the morning standup meeting on time.

The meeting itself was brutal. Our project is behind schedule and the client is getting impatient. My manager was clearly stressed, which made everyone else tense. I spent most of the morning trying to debug a particularly nasty race condition in the authentication module. After three hours of staring at logs and adding print statements everywhere, I finally found the culprit - a missing mutex lock that I had accidentally removed during last week's refactor.

Lunch was a welcome break. Went to the new Vietnamese place down the street with a few colleagues. The pho was amazing - perfectly seasoned broth, tender beef, fresh herbs. We spent the whole hour complaining about work, which felt cathartic even if it didn't solve anything. Sometimes you just need to vent.

The afternoon went much better. Fixed the bug, wrote tests to make sure it doesn't happen again, and even had time to review two pull requests from junior developers. Gave constructive feedback and helped one of them understand async/await patterns better. Teaching others always reminds me of how far I've come.

Came home around 7pm, ordered pizza, and watched two episodes of that documentary series everyone's been talking about. The one about cults is fascinating and disturbing at the same time. Now I'm lying in bed writing this, feeling grateful for ordinary days that turn out to be pretty good after all.

Tomorrow I need to: buy groceries, call the dentist to reschedule, and finish reviewing the architecture proposal. But that's tomorrow's problem.
