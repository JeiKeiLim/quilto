Comprehensive GRE study session today - 5 hours total, broken into focused blocks with breaks in between. I'm taking the test in 6 weeks and aiming for 165+ on both verbal and quant.

Started at 8am with quantitative section practice. Did a full section from the official ETS practice book - 20 questions in 35 minutes. Scored 17/20 which is decent but not where I want to be. The questions I missed were all about probability and combinatorics - my weakest areas. One was about arrangements where identical items reduce permutations (divide by factorial of repeats), another about conditional probability that I misread as independent events.

Spent the next hour specifically drilling probability. Created flashcards for the key formulas: combinations vs permutations, Bayes' theorem, expected value, geometric probability. Worked through 25 probability problems from multiple prep books. By the end, the patterns were more recognizable.

After a 20-minute coffee break, switched to verbal. The vocabulary is endless - I have an Anki deck with 1,200 words and I'm only through about 400 of them. Today I learned: perspicacious (having keen mental perception), pulchritude (physical beauty), and tendentious (expressing a controversial opinion). The reading comprehension is fine; it's the sentence equivalence that kills me because subtle synonym differences matter.

Lunch break was 45 minutes - ate while watching a YouTube video about GRE test-taking strategies. The guy emphasized time management and flagging difficult questions to return to. Makes sense in theory but hard to implement when anxious.

Afternoon was a full-length practice test: verbal, quant, experimental section, and two essays. The essays are graded on a 6-point scale and I usually get 4.5-5.0. Today's prompts were about whether governments should fund arts programs and analyzing an argument about business expansion. Wrote both in the 30-minute limits. The Analyze an Argument essay is actually fun - just finding logical fallacies.

Final scores: Verbal 162, Quant 164. Better than last week but still need improvement. The fatigue in the last section is real - my accuracy dropped noticeably in the final 10 questions of each section.

Tomorrow: Rest day for the brain. Will just do light vocab review and maybe watch some khan academy videos about geometry (another weak spot).
