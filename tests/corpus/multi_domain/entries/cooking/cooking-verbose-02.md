Spent the morning perfecting my sourdough bread technique. I've been maintaining my starter "Bubbles" for 6 months now, feeding it twice daily, and I think I finally cracked the code on getting that perfect ear and open crumb.

The night before, I did an autolyse: mixed 450g bread flour, 50g whole wheat flour, and 375g water. Let it sit covered for 2 hours at room temperature to develop gluten. Then I added 100g of active, bubbly starter and 10g of fine sea salt. Mixed by hand using the pinching method - squeezing the dough between thumb and fingers repeatedly for about 5 minutes.

The bulk fermentation took 5 hours at around 78°F (kept the dough in the oven with just the light on for warmth). Did 4 sets of stretch and folds during the first 2 hours - every 30 minutes. By the end of bulk, the dough had doubled and was puffy with visible bubbles on the surface and sides.

Pre-shaped into a round, let it rest 20 minutes, then did the final shape - tight boule, pulling the surface taut but trying not to degas too much. Placed seam-side up into a rice-flour-dusted banneton, then into the fridge for overnight retard - about 12 hours.

Baked in a preheated Dutch oven at 500°F with the lid on for 20 minutes, then removed lid and dropped temperature to 450°F for another 25 minutes until the crust was deep mahogany and the internal temperature read 210°F.

The result: beautiful ear where I scored, crackling crust that sang as it cooled, and when I cut into it - the most gorgeous open crumb I've ever achieved. Large, irregular holes, slightly glossy interior, mild tangy flavor.

Photographed extensively. Ate half the loaf with just butter while still warm. Zero regrets. This is the one I'm bringing to Christmas dinner.
