Today I attempted Julia Child's Boeuf Bourguignon for the first time. This is a dish I've been intimidated by for years, but I finally had a free Sunday and all the ingredients.

Started at 10am by cutting 3 pounds of beef chuck into 2-inch cubes, then drying them thoroughly with paper towels - this is crucial for getting a good sear. Seasoned generously with salt and pepper. In my large Dutch oven, rendered 6 ounces of thick-cut bacon until crispy, set aside. Used the bacon fat to brown the beef in batches - didn't crowd the pan, about 5 pieces at a time, 3-4 minutes per side until deep golden brown.

After all beef was browned and set aside, sauteed 2 cups of sliced onions and 2 cups of sliced carrots in the same pot until softened, about 10 minutes. Added 3 tablespoons of flour, stirred for 2 minutes to cook out the raw taste. Poured in an entire bottle of good Burgundy wine (750ml) and 2 cups of beef stock. The smell at this point was incredible.

Returned the beef and bacon to the pot, added a bouquet garni (thyme, bay leaves, parsley stems tied in cheesecloth), 3 cloves of crushed garlic, and 2 tablespoons of tomato paste. Brought to a simmer, then into the oven at 325°F for 3 hours.

During the last hour, separately cooked 24 pearl onions (blanched and peeled, then braised in butter and stock until tender) and 1 pound of quartered cremini mushrooms (sauteed in butter until golden). Added these to the stew for the final 15 minutes.

Total cooking time: nearly 5 hours including prep. The meat was fall-apart tender, the sauce was glossy and deeply flavored, the whole house smelled like a French countryside bistro. Served with crusty bread and the remaining wine.

This is definitely a weekend-only recipe but worth every minute. Will make again for special occasions. The leftovers actually taste even better the next day after the flavors have melded further.
