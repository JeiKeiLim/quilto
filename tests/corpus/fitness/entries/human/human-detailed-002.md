Today was frustrating. Got to the gym at 5:30pm after work, already pretty tired from a long day of meetings. Was planning to do a proper pull day but the cable machine was broken - sign said "out of order" - so had to rework my entire plan on the spot.

Started with barbell rows instead of cable rows. Warmed up with 40kg for 10 reps, then did 60kg for 8 reps across 4 sets. Grip was giving out by the last set, probably because I was tired from typing all day.

Moved to lat pulldowns on the other cable machine (thankfully that one worked). Did 50kg for 12 reps, 3 sets. Guy next to me was doing some weird exercise and kept bumping into me, lost my rhythm a bit.

Was gonna do face pulls but the rope attachment was missing (seriously, where do these things go?). Did rear delt flies with 8kg dumbbells instead, 15 reps for 3 sets. Finished with some deadlifts - kept it light at 100kg for 5 reps, 3 sets since I was already gassed.

Not my best workout but got through it. Sometimes you just gotta adapt.
