Two weeks ago I tweaked my lower back doing deadlifts (went too heavy too fast, classic mistake). Today was my first time back doing a proper back workout, so I was being extra careful. Physical therapist said light weights, focus on form, stop if anything feels off.

Started super conservative with lat pulldowns. 40kg felt fine, did 15 reps just to get blood flowing. Gradually worked up to 55kg for 10 reps, did 3 sets. No pain, just a little tightness which is normal apparently.

Moved to seated cable rows at 45kg, 12 reps for 3 sets. Focused on squeezing my shoulder blades together, keeping core tight. The mind-muscle connection was actually really good today - maybe because I was paying so much attention to form.

Skipped deadlifts completely (too soon). Did some light hyperextensions instead - bodyweight only, 3 sets of 12. Felt weird not loading my back but better safe than sorry.

Finished with face pulls at 12.5kg, 15 reps, 3 sets. Overall a productive session considering the circumstances. Back feels okay now, a little tired but no sharp pain. Progress.
