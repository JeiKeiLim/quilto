Today I did... wait no let me start over. Got to the gym around 6pm, did arms. Biceps first no wait triceps first. Tricep pushdowns 25kg 4 sets of 12. Then skull crushers with the EZ bar, I think it was 20kg total? Did 3 sets of 10. Now biceps. Barbell curls 25kg, no actually it was 20kg, did like 4 sets of... hmm probably 10 each. Hammer curls after that 10kg dumbbells each hand, 3 sets of 12. Oh I forgot I also did dips at the beginning before everything. Bodyweight, maybe 3 sets of 8? And I was gonna do concentration curls but ran out of time so skipped those.
