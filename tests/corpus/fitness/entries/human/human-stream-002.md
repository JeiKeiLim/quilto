So today was supposed to be back day but the gym was packed like crazy. Started with lat pulldowns, did like 50kg or something for warmup then went up to 70. Did maybe 4 sets? Could have been 5 actually I lost count because this guy kept asking me when I'd be done. Anyway moved to rows after that. Cable rows I mean not barbell, the barbell area was too crowded. Put it on like 60kg did 3 sets of 10 I think. Oh wait I also did some face pulls at the end, really light like 15kg for 3 sets of 15. Was gonna do deadlifts but gave up cuz no space. Stretching and done.
