Some text before code block

```python
def workout():
    print("bench press")
    # This code block is never closed

More text that should be inside code block maybe?

Another unclosed block:
```javascript
console.log("never closed");

And inline code without closing: `print("hello)

Triple backticks not on own line: ```python print("inline") ```

Nested unclosed:
````
Outer block
```
Inner block never closed
